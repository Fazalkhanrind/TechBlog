        <h3>3. Keep Software Updated</h3>
        <p>Regularly update your operating system, antivirus software, and all applications. Enable automatic updates where possible.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Secure Video Conferencing</h3>
        <p>Use waiting rooms, require passwords for meetings, and be cautious about screen sharing sensitive information.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Practice Safe Email Habits</h3>
        <p>Be vigilant about phishing attempts, verify sender identities, and never click suspicious links or download unexpected attachments.</p>
        
        <h3>6. Backup Your Data</h3>
        <p>Implement the 3-2-1 backup rule: 3 copies of data, 2 different storage types, 1 offsite backup.</p>
